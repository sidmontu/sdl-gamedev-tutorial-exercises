# Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) -- C++ Projects
# SDL Gamedev Tutorial Exercises (Uses SDL2)

Source: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php

Just going through each tutorial one at a time slowly..

## Usage
Each tutorial is self-contained. Type make tutorial-<number> to compile the project. <number> is a 2-digit numeral. E.g. to compile tutorial 1, type `make tutorial-01`. The compiled executable is stored in ./bin/ directory, and can be run by typing `./bin/tutorial-<number>`.

I try and comment and innovate a little here and there on the side, but largely follow the tutorial. Full credit to Lazy Foo' Productions for tutorial and code chunks.

## Dependencies

You must have SDL2 installed. For Linux, `apt-get install libsdl2-dev` should suffice, for macOS, `brew install sdl2` should work. You might have to update INCLUDE and LIB flags to compile properly for your environment inside the Makefile. Run `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` to see the include and library paths that you would need to append to compile the C++ projects.
